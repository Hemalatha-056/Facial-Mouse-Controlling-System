Facial Mouse Controlling System aims to let users control a virtual mouse with facial
expressions. In the current world, interacting with computers is essential. Physically
disabled people may find it challenging to use a mouse, thus we have suggested this mouse
control utilizing facial expressions as a possible option for those individuals. They can
move the mouse with their face by using their eyes, nose and mouth. The user has the
choice to blink, which causes the mouse to be clicked when using the left eye and while
using the right eye. Squinting your eyes will start the scroll mode. The pointer moves in
one of two directions: left or right.
